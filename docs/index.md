  <p> [1] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/RelativeDiffusion3.pdf">A Simple Model of Brownian Motion in Spacetime</a></p>

<p>
  Comments: This is a more sophisticated development of ideas from [8]. This paper is more rigorous than the others, which is an important improvement I would like to maintain. This is also currently in a rougher state than the others; I still need to clarify the meaning of "Cartesian" elliptic symmetry, and need to consider more carefully the definitions of some of the integrals. Also need to compile references.

  <a href="https://iff3.github.io/RelativeInvariantThermo2.pdf">A Relativistically Invariant Formulation of The Canonical Ensemble and The Transformation Law for Temperature</a> </p>
  
  <p>
     Comments: References for this are essentially identical to those in [5]. This paper is a better development of the foundational ideas from [5].

  <p> [3] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/ParamTime2.pdf">Implications of The Assumption of Parametric Time on Wavefunction Collapse and A Resulting Analogy with Killing Horizon Thermodynamics</a></p>
 
<p>
  Comments: The first part of this paper would be essentially completely tautological if it weren't for the derivation of the non-unitary evolution operator. Nontheless, that derivation isn't particularly novel, and those ideas should be developed more to give actual predictions. The second part of the paper is better developed, and presents I think a very interesting similarity between wavefunction collapse and Killing horizons. Overall this paper has what I think are some very interesting ideas and interpretations of perhaps already known physics, but needs to develop them more.

  <p> [4] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/MastersThesis.pdf">An Exploration of Possibly Natural Geometries on Directed Acyclic Graphs</a>

<p>Comments: My Masters Thesis on the extension of network geometry to directed acyclic graphs. The first half is theoretical, the second half is computational. There was some more content I wanted to add but I did not have enough space/was not concise enough to add it.</p>
