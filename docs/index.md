  <p> [1] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/RelativeDiffusion3.pdf">A Relativistic Study of Diffusion Using Local Random Walks</a></p>
  
  <p>
    Abstract: The simplest possible random walk model in Minwkoski spacetime is constructed and analyzed. It is shown that the model leads to a non-hyperbolic heat equation with the unique property that its coefficients depend on the boundary conditions of the distribution, which allows one to safely break Lorentz symmetry at the level of system initialisation. The properties of this PDE are analyzed, and it is found that the PDE has a Klein-Gordon like Lagrangian description under the appropriate coordinate transformation, which with a Wick rotation becomes the Klein-Gordon equation exactly; a conserved current similar to Fourier's heat law; and a Riemannian metric with a Cartesian elliptic symmetry.

  Comments: This is a more sophisticated development of ideas from [8]. This paper is more rigorous than the others, which is an important improvement I would like to maintain. This is also currently in a rougher state than the others; I still need to clarify the meaning of "Cartesian" elliptic symmetry, and need to consider more carefully the definitions of some of the integrals. Also need to compile references.

  <a href="https://iff3.github.io/RelativeInvariantThermo2.pdf">A Relativistically Invariant Formulation of The Canonical Ensemble and The Transformation Law for Temperature</a> </p>
  
  <p>
  Abstract: An invariant Boltzmann distribution is derived by exploiting the symmetries between relativistic energy and momentum, ultimately leading to the realization of an inverse four-temperature. The form of the four temperature is constrained and the Boltzmann distribution is shown to agree with the Maxwell-Jutner distribution. It is further shown that taking the distribution off-shell leads to a natural PDE for the partition function similar in form to the Klein-Gordon equation. This ultimately leads to a generalization of the Wick rotation correspondence between quantum and statistical mechanics, as well as an interesting interpretation of Lorentz group gauge theories.

     Comments: References for this are essentially identical to those in [5]. This paper is a better development of the foundational ideas from [5].

  <p> [3] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/ParamTime2.pdf">Implications of The Assumption of Parametric Time on Wavefunction Collapse and A Resulting Analogy with Killing Horizon Thermodynamics</a></p>
  
  <p>
  Abstract: Two basic assumptions are applied here which enable us to probe the nature of wavefunction collapse. Firstly, we expect all levels of physics to be described in terms of systems in states. Secondly, time is parametric and not associated with an operator. From these assumptions we argue the existence of a thermodynamic nonunitary operator governing collapse, and analyze its behaviour. We then note that the property of wavefunction collapse to conceal a systems previous states from an observer is similar to the concealment of the past of an infalling system at a future Killing Horizon. This leads to the reinterpretation of the behaviour of the redshift factor at a horizon in a stationary spacetime as a manifestation of wavefunction collapse, and so Hawking radiation as a consequence of the same phenomenon.

  Comments: The first part of this paper would be essentially completely tautological if it weren't for the derivation of the non-unitary evolution operator. Nontheless, that derivation isn't particularly novel, and those ideas should be developed more to give actual predictions. The second part of the paper is better developed, and presents I think a very interesting similarity between wavefunction collapse and Killing horizons. Overall this paper has what I think are some very interesting ideas and interpretations of perhaps already known physics, but needs to develop them more.

  <p> [4] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/RGGforPhys.pdf">An Introduction To Random Geometric Graphs for Physicists</a>


<p>Abstract: The goal of the project is to understand the critical behaviour of randomly generated Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG), with particular interest in infinite clusters, connectivity, and network geodesics. In this sense, the hope is to elucidate the nature of information flow in complex, real world systems. This writing will give an overview on similar results for undirected, Random Geometric Graphs (RGGs) as background. It will cover the Poisson Point Process, Campbell's Theorems, typical connection models, and monotonic, infinite cluster, and full connectivity phase transitions.</p>

<p>Comments: A litterature review anticipating my MSci project. Many of the proofs in this area of mathematics are not quite suited for the typical physicist, so I ended up coming up with intutions pointing towards equivalent or similar results myself.</p>
