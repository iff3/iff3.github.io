  <a href="https://iff3.github.io/RelativeInvariantThermo.pdf">A Relativistically Invariant Formulation of The Canonical Ensemble and The Transformation Law for Temperature</a> </p>
  
  <p>
  Abstract: An invariant Boltzmann distribution is derived by exploiting the symmetries between relativistic energy and momentum, ultimately leading to the realization of an inverse four-temperature. The form of the four temperature is constrained and the Boltzmann distribution is shown to agree with the Maxwell-Jutner distribution. It is further shown that taking the distribution off-shell leads to a natural PDE for the partition function similar in form to the Klein-Gordon equation. This ultimately leads to a generalization of the wick rotation correspondence between quantum and statistical mechanics, as well as an interesting interpretation of Lorentz group gauge theories.

     Comments: References for this are essentially identical to those in [5]. This paper is a better development of the foundational ideas from [5]. Currently thinking about how this can be applied to the FLRW spacetime and the cosmic fluid. FLRW is non-static, but conformally equivalent to (A)dS. A photon bath should therefore be in thermodynamic equilibrium, but I suspect other matter will actually not be.

  <p> [2] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/RelativeDiffusion.pdf">A Relativistic Study of Diffusion Using Local Random Walks</a></p>
  
  <p>
    Abstract: The diffusion of a relativistic gas on a Lorentzian manifold is modelled as a random walk, in which the decorrelation of a particles current state from its past is treated as a decay of information. From this a diffusion equation is retrieved which is fully relativistic, and obeys the second law of thermodynamics. It is then shown that by a change of variables that this diffusion equation can be made to resemble the Klein-Gordon Equation, leading to a nice set of analogies between classical statistical motion, and quantum statistical motion.

Comments: The end section of this paper uses some clever tricks to simplify the notation, although there are some subtleties to these tricks I have not yet picked apart. Many of the takeaways of this paper are similar to those of [1]: firstly, statistical systems have an arrow of time, which manifest mathematically as a 4-vector designating the relevant systems rest frame; and secondly, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics are related by the fact that QM systems have compact, rotational phases, while SM systems have non-compact, hyperbolic phases ("generalized Wick rotation").

  <p> [3] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/ParamTime.pdf">Implications of The Assumption of Parametric Time on Wavefunction Collapse and A Resulting Analogy with Killing Horizon Thermodynamics</a></p>
  
  <p>
  Abstract: Three basic assumptions are applied here which enable us to probe the nature of wavefunction collapse. Firstly, we expect all levels of physics to be described in terms of systems in states. Secondly, time is parametric and not associated with an operator. Thirdly, the property of wavefunction collapse to conceal all of a systems previous states from an observer is similar to the concealment of a systems past states by event horizons in gravity. From the first two assumptions we argue the existence of a thermodynamic nonunitary operator governing collapse, and with the last assumption argue that this thermodynamics is similar to that of stationary horizons, such that Quantum Mechanics can be reformulated in terms of the killing fields generating those horizons.

  Comments: The first part of this paper would be essentially completely tautological if it weren't for the derivation of the non-unitary evolution operator. Nontheless, that derivation isn't particularly novel, and those ideas should be developed more to give actual predictions. The second part of the paper is better developed, and presents I think a very interesting similarity between wavefunction collapse and Killing horizons. Overall this paper has what I think are some very interesting ideas and interpretations of perhaps already known physics, but needs to develop them more.

  <p><a href="https://iff3.github.io/RGGforPhys.pdf">An Introduction To Random Geometric Graphs for Physicists</a>


<p>Abstract: The goal of the project is to understand the critical behaviour of randomly generated Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG), with particular interest in infinite clusters, connectivity, and network geodesics. In this sense, the hope is to elucidate the nature of information flow in complex, real world systems. This writing will give an overview on similar results for undirected, Random Geometric Graphs (RGGs) as background. It will cover the Poisson Point Process, Campbell's Theorems, typical connection models, and monotonic, infinite cluster, and full connectivity phase transitions.</p>

<p>Comments: A litterature review anticipating my MSci project. Many of the proofs in this area of mathematics are not quite suited for the typical physicist, so I ended up coming up with intutions pointing towards equivalent or similar results myself.</p>
