  <p style="font-size:11px;">
  Abstract: An invariant Boltzmann distribution is derived by exploiting the symmetries between relativistic energy and momentum, ultimately leading to the realization of an inverse four-temperature $\beta^\mu$. The form of the four temperature is constrained and the Boltzmann distribution is shown to agree with the Maxwell-J\"utner distribution. It is further shown that taking the distribution off-shell leads to a natural PDE for the partition function similar in form to the Klein-Gordon equation. This ultimately leads to a generalization of the wick rotation correspondence between quantum and statistical mechanics, as well as an interesting interpretation of Lorentz group gauge theories.

     Comments: References for this are essentially identical to those in [5]. This paper is a better development of the foundational ideas from [5]. Currently thinking about how this can be applied to the FRLW spacetime and the cosmic fluid. FLRW is non-static, but conformally equivalent to (A)dS. A photon bath should therefore be in thermodynamic equilibrium, but I suspect other matter will actually not be.

  <p> [2] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/RelativeDiffusion.pdf">A Relativistic Study of Diffusion Using Local Random Walks</a></p>
  <p style="font-size:11px;">
    The diffusion of a relativistic gas on a Lorentzian manifold is modelled as a random walk, in which the decorrelation of a particles current state from its past is treated as a decay of information. From this a diffusion equation is retrieved which is fully relativistic, and obeys the second law of thermodynamics. It is then shown that by a change of variables that this diffusion equation can be made to resemble the Klein-Gordon Equation, leading to a nice set of analogies between classical statistical motion, and quantum statistical motion.
