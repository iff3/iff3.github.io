<h3>0 Introduction</h3>
    <p>
  I am a recent graduate of the MSci Physics with Theoretical Physics program at Imperial College London, and a current theory stream student of the M2 Fundamental Physics program at the University of Aix-Marseille. My interests mainly lie in the intersection between black hole physics, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. At the moment I am curious about the origin of analogies between the theory of deformable bodies and manifolds, and how these analogies might help to understand the thermodynamic nature of spacetime. I am also curious about the interplay of horizon physics and foundational quantum mechanics/quantum information.
  </p>
  The purpose of this website is to keep track of some of the work I have done over the years. This includes developing some basic equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics in a Lorentz covariant way, investigating the relationship between geometry and dense directed acyclic networks, and miscellaneous mathematical tricks. I also sometimes write music, so I've put a bit of that here too!

<h3>1 Papers</h3>
  
  <p> [1.1] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/RelativeDiffusion3.pdf">A Simple Model of Brownian Motion in Spacetime</a></p>

<p>
  Comments: This is a more sophisticated development of ideas from [3.2]. This paper is more rigorous than the others, which is an important improvement I would like to maintain. This is also currently in a rougher state than the others; I still need to clarify the meaning of "Cartesian" elliptic symmetry, and need to consider more carefully the regulation of some integrals. Also need to compile references.

<p> [1.2]
  <a href="https://iff3.github.io/RelativeInvariantThermo2.pdf">A Relativistically Invariant Formulation of The Canonical Ensemble and The Transformation Law for Temperature</a> </p>
  
  <p>
     Comments: References for this are essentially identical to those in [3.1]. This paper is a better development of the foundational ideas from [3.1].

  <p> [1.3] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/MastersThesis.pdf">An Exploration of Possibly Natural Geometries on Directed Acyclic Graphs</a>

<p>Comments: My MSci Thesis from Imperial, on the extension of network geometry to directed acyclic graphs. The first half is theoretical, the second half is computational. There was some more content I wanted to add but I did not have enough space/was not concise enough to add it.</p>
  
  
  
  <p> [1.4] <a href="https://iff3.github.io/ParamTime2.pdf">Implications of The Assumption of Parametric Time on Wavefunction Collapse and A Resulting Analogy with Killing Horizon Thermodynamics</a></p>
 
<p>
  Comments: The first part of this paper would be essentially completely tautological if it weren't for the derivation of the non-unitary evolution operator. Nontheless, that derivation isn't particularly novel, and those ideas should be developed more to give actual predictions. The second part of the paper is better developed, though the basic assumotions/principles aren't very rigorously supported, and need to be interpreted better.
